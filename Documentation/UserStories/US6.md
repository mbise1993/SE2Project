US 6 - Add New Client
=======

User Story
---
As an employee I want to be able to add a new client to the database so that I can keep track of the client.


Conversation
----
	* If the client already exists in the database but is inactive, do we want to only edit their current information or create a new client?

Acceptance Criteria
----
	* Administrator/employee should be able to successfully add a client to the database.
